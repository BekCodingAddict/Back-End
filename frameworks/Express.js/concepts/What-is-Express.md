# What is Express.js?

>[!TIP]
>Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It is designed to simplify the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a robust set of features for handling HTTP requests, middleware, routing, and more.

## Key Features of Express.js:
### 1. Routing:
- Provides a simple and intuitive way to define routes for your web application.
- Supports dynamic routing and route parameters.

### 2.Middleware:
- Middleware functions in Express.js can process requests, handle errors, or modify responses.
- Makes it easier to handle tasks like authentication, logging, or parsing request bodies.

### 3.HTTP Methods:
- Supports all HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., for handling RESTful APIs.

### 4.Template Engines:
- Allows integration with template engines like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars for rendering dynamic HTML.

### Static File Serving:
- Can serve static assets like CSS files, images, and JavaScript files

### 6.Scalability:
- Lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for both small projects and large-scale applications.

## Advantages:
- Easy to set up and use.
- Highly customizable.
- Active community and extensive documentation.
- Works seamlessly with other Node.js modules.

### Example:
Here's a basic Express.js application:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Define a route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

// Start the server
const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```
Common Use Cases:
 - Building RESTful APIs.
 - Creating web applications.
 - Developing middleware for handling requests and responses.
