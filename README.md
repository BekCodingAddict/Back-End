# Back-End

>[!TIP]
>The back-end is the part of a web application or system that handles the server-side operations, meaning it works behind the scenes to manage and process data, logic, and server responses. It powers the functionality of the front-end, which is the part of the application that users directly interact with.

### Here are the main responsibilities of the back-end:
1. Data Processing
- Handles requests sent by the front-end.
- Processes and validates the data submitted by users (e.g., login details, form submissions).

2. Database Management
- Stores, retrieves, updates, or deletes data in a database.
- Examples of databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite.

3. Server Logic
- Implements the core logic for business operations.
- Runs calculations, automates tasks, or handles API integrations.

4. Server Management
- Maintains the server that hosts the application.
- Ensures the app runs smoothly, securely, and efficiently.

5. Security
- Protects sensitive data like passwords, payment details, and user information.
- Implements authentication (e.g., login systems) and authorization (e.g., user roles).

### Common Back-End Technologies:
- Languages: JavaScript (Node.js), Python, PHP, Java, Ruby, C#, etc.
- Frameworks: Express.js, Django, Laravel, Spring Boot, etc.
- Databases: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.
- APIs: REST, GraphQL.
