## What is a server, and how does it handle requests?
A server is a computer or software system that provides services, data, or resources to other devices, known as clients, over a network. It listens for incoming requests, processes them, and responds accordingly. Servers can be physical machines, virtual instances, or cloud-based services.

### How a Server Handles Requests
1. Listening for Requests
   - The server runs on a specific IP address and port number (e.g., https://example.com:443 for HTTPS).
   - It continuously listens for incoming client requests (from browsers, mobile apps, APIs, etc.)

2. Receiving and Parsing the Request
   - When a client sends a request (e.g., HTTP request), the server receives it and extracts relevant details like:
     - Method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
     - Headers (authentication, content type, etc.)
     - Body (payload, form data, JSON, etc.)
    
3. Processing the Request
   - The server routes the request to the correct handler (e.g., fetching data from a database, processing logic, etc.).
   - It might interact with:
     - Databases (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB)
     - External APIs (e.g., payment gateways, third-party services)
     - Business logic (authentication, validation, computations)
    
4. Generating a Response
  - The server prepares a response in a structured format (JSON, HTML, XML, etc.).
  - Includes status codes:
    - 200 OK (Success)
    - 404 Not Found (Resource missing)
    - 500 Internal Server Error (Unexpected failure)
   
5. Sending the Response
  - The response is sent back to the client over the network.
  - The client (browser, app, API consumer) processes and displays the result.

## Example: Handling a Web Request (Express.js - Node.js Server)
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: "Hello, World!" });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));

```
- The server listens on port 3000.
- When a client makes a request to /hello, it responds with {"message": "Hello, World!"}.
