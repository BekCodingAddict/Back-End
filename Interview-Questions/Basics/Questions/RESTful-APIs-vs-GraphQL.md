# RESTful API vs. GraphQL
Both RESTful APIs and GraphQL are used for building APIs, but they have different approaches to handling data retrieval and communication between clients and servers.

## What is a RESTful API?
A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an API architecture that follows REST principles. It uses HTTP methods to perform operations on resources, which are represented as endpoints (URLs).

### Key Characteristics of RESTful API:
  - Uses HTTP methods:
    - GET → Retrieve data
    - POST → Create data
    - PUT/PATCH → Update data
    - DELETE → Remove data

  - Resource-based URL structure
    Example:
    - GET /users → Fetch all users
    - GET /users/1 → Fetch user with ID 1
    - POST /users → Create a new user
  - Uses JSON or XML as response format (Mostly JSON)
  - Stateless → Each request is independent and contains all necessary information.

### Example: REST API Request (Fetching a User)
```http
GET /users/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json
```
Response:
```js
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```
## What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a query language for APIs developed by Facebook that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. Instead of multiple endpoints, GraphQL has a single endpoint where clients specify the structure of the response.

### Key Characteristics of GraphQL:
  - Single Endpoint (/graphql instead of multiple REST endpoints)
  - Flexible Queries → Clients request only required fields.
  - Strongly Typed Schema → Defines types, queries, and mutations.
  - Reduces Overfetching & Underfetching
### Example: GraphQL Query (Fetching a User)
```graphql
query {
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    email
  }
}
```
Response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## When to Use REST vs. GraphQL
### ✅ Use REST if:
  - ✔ Simple API with predictable responses
  - ✔ Caching is a priority (GraphQL caching is complex)
  - ✔ Works well with microservices

### ✅ Use GraphQL if:
  - ✔ Need to fetch complex, nested data in one request
  - ✔ Want a flexible API for frontend developers
  - ✔ Avoid overfetching and underfetching

## Final Thoughts
Both RESTful APIs and GraphQL have their strengths. REST is widely used, simpler, and works well for most applications, while GraphQL offers more flexibility and efficiency in handling complex queries.
