## What is TCP?
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a fundamental communication protocol used in computer networks to ensure reliable data transmission between devices. It operates at the transport layer of the OSI model and works alongside the Internet Protocol (IP) as part of the TCP/IP suite.

### Key Features of TCP:
1. Reliable Data Transfer – Ensures that all data packets reach their destination in the correct order.
2. Connection-Oriented – Establishes a connection between sender and receiver before data is transmitted.
3. Error Checking & Correction – Detects errors and requests retransmission if necessary.
4. Flow Control – Regulates data transmission to prevent overwhelming the receiver.
5. Congestion Control – Adjusts data transmission speed based on network traffic conditions.

### How TCP Works:
1. Three-Way Handshake – Establishes a connection (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
2 Data Transmission – Splits data into packets, numbers them, and ensures they are received in the right order.
3 Acknowledgment & Retransmission – Lost or corrupted packets are retransmitted.
4 Connection Termination – Gracefully closes the connection when communication is complete.

### Common Applications Using TCP:
- Web Browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)
- File Transfer (FTP)
- Remote Access (SSH, Telnet)
