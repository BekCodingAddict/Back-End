## What is IP (Internet Protocol)?
IP (Internet Protocol) is a fundamental protocol in computer networking that is responsible for addressing and routing data packets across the internet and local networks. It operates at the network layer of the OSI model and works alongside TCP in the TCP/IP protocol suite.

### Key Functions of IP:
1. Addressing – Assigns a unique IP address to each device on a network.
2. Routing – Determines the best path for data to travel across networks.
3. Packetization – Breaks data into packets for efficient transmission.
4. Connectionless Communication – Does not establish a dedicated connection before sending data.

### Types of IP Addresses:
- IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4) – Uses a 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6) – Uses a 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334), designed to replace IPv4 due to address exhaustion.


### How IP Works:
1. A sender (computer, phone, or server) creates data and attaches an IP header with source and destination IP addresses.
2. Routers analyze the IP header and forward the packet toward the destination
3. At the destination, the receiving device extracts and processes the data

### IP vs. TCP
- IP ensures that packets are sent to the right destination.
- TCP ensures that the packets arrive reliably and in order.
