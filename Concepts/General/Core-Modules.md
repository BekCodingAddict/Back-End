## What is Core Modules?

>[!TIP]
>Core modules are the built-in modules provided by a programming language or environment. They are part of its standard library, and you can use them directly without needing to install or download additional packages.

>In Node.js, for example, core modules provide essential functionality for building server-side applications. These modules are compiled into Node.js and are accessible using the require or import statements.

### Examples of Node.js Core Modules
- fs (File System): For working with the file system.
- http: For creating HTTP servers and handling requests and responses.
- os: For accessing operating system-related information.
- path: For working with file and directory paths.
- crypto: For cryptographic operations like hashing and encryption.
- util: For utility functions, like formatting strings or debugging.

### Key Features of Core Modules
- No Installation Needed: They are built into the runtime, so you can use them right away.
- Highly Optimized: Designed for performance and reliability.
- Widely Used: Common tasks like reading files, creating servers, or handling streams often rely on these modules.
