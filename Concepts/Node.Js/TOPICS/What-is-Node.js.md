## What is Node.js?

>[!TIP]
>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside a web browser. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which powers Google Chrome, and enables JavaScript to be used for building server-side applications.

### Key Features of Node.js:

1.Asynchronous and Event-Driven
- Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient for handling multiple concurrent operations.

2.Single-Threaded
- Although it runs on a single thread, Node.js can handle many simultaneous connections using an event loop, making it well-suited for I/O-heavy tasks like API calls or database queries.

3. Cross-Platform
- Node.js works on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

4.NPM (Node Package Manager)
- Node.js includes NPM, a massive ecosystem of open-source libraries and tools, which simplifies building applications by allowing developers to reuse existing packages.

### Common Use Cases:
- Building APIs (e.g., RESTful APIs or GraphQL APIs)
- Real-time applications (e.g., chat apps, online games)
- Web servers
- Microservices
- Serverless applications
- Tools for front-end development, like bundlers and task runners

### Why Use Node.js?
- High performance: Its non-blocking architecture is ideal for real-time applications.
- Unified language: Developers can use JavaScript on both the front end and back end.
0 Large ecosystem: NPM provides a wide range of tools and libraries.
