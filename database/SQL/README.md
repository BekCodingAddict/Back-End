# What is SQL?
>[!NOTE]
>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to perform various operations on data stored in databases, such as:

1. Querying data: Retrieving specific data from a database (using the SELECT statement).
2. Inserting data: Adding new records into a database (using the INSERT statement).
3. Updating data: Modifying existing records in a database (using the UPDATE statement).
4. Deleting data: Removing records from a database (using the DELETE statement).
5. Creating and modifying structures: Defining and altering database schema, including creating tables, modifying columns, or deleting structures (using CREATE, ALTER, and DROP statements).
6. Data manipulation: Sorting, filtering, and grouping data to get insights or organized results (using ORDER BY, WHERE, GROUP BY, etc.).

SQL works with relational databases, where data is stored in tables with rows (records) and columns (fields), and relationships between data can be defined using keys. It is widely used in many databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.
