# Database
>[!NOTE]
>A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed in a way that allows for easy retrieval, modification, and management. It is used to store information such as records, documents, or any other form of data that needs to be stored systematically.

There are different types of databases, including:
1. Relational Databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL): Store data in tables with rows and columns, and data is related to one another through keys.
2. NoSQL Databases (e.g., MongoDB, Redis): Used for unstructured data or data that doesnâ€™t fit into tables, often preferred for scalability and flexibility.
3. In-Memory Databases (e.g., Redis): Store data in memory for faster access but may be less persistent.

Databases allow for operations like insertion, deletion, updating, and querying of data, ensuring it is stored efficiently and is easy to access when needed.
